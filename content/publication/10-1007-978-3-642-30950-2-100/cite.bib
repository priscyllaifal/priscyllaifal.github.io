 abstract = {This paper reports on preliminary efforts to develop a multi- agent-based Intelligent Tutoring System for teaching propositional logic using two integrated approaches with focus on checking the validation of a given argument. One motivation for this integration comes from the importance to involve students in two complementary viewpoints, permitting students to make connections between the two viewpoints involving different strategies, used in problem solving situations.},
