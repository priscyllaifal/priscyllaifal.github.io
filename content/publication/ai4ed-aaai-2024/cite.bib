  abstract = 	 {Machine learning and deep learning models are pivotal in educational contexts, particularly in predicting student success. Despite their widespread application, a significant gap persists in comprehending the factors influencing these models’ predictions, especially in explainability within education. This work addresses this gap by employing nine distinct explanation methods and conducting a comprehensive analysis to explore the correlation between the agreement among these methods in generating explanations and the predictive model’s performance. Applying Spearman’s correlation, our findings reveal a very strong correlation between the model’s performance and the level of agreement observed among the explanation methods.}
