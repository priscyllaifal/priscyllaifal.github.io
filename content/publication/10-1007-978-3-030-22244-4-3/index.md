abstract: 'This paper describes an approach to help students involved in a Programming
  Tutoring System, providing them with feedback during the coding problem-solving
  activities. It provides feedback for students during the coding, helping them to
  fix mistakes and how to take the next steps to complete the solution. This way,
  the student does not need to complete and submit a solution to get feedback from
  the system. The approach uses three feedback resources: videos, text hints, and
  flowcharts. We conducted an experiment involving 34 students from a programming
  introduction course. Preliminary results indicated a positive impact on the students
  learning. Our results also suggested that we can provide valuable feedback to students
  with difficult to complete a solution.'
